# README

This project was made for HackED 2018. It serves as mvp for a karma based carpooling app with 2 flows: rider and driver. Once you give a ride to someone, you get a karma point enabling you to switch to rider mode and use that point to catch a ride when you're in need. 

Truly, what goes around comes around.
